Guten Tag 👋  
I'm Harish Somaghatta, a Machine Learning Engineer based in Germany. I completed my Master’s in Computational Materials Science from TU Bergakademie Freiberg and my Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering from Anna University, India. I have professional experience at Robert Bosch GmbH and Sanmina-SCI, where I worked on machine learning, data engineering, and automation. As a software and data enthusiast, I’m passionate about building scalable ML systems and making technology more accessible and reliable for everyone.

I enjoy writing **clean code**, using **version control** properly, and turning ideas into **reproducible ML systems**.

 I am passionate about:  
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- MLOps, Model Deployment & Automation  
- Bayesian & Probabilistic Modeling  
- High-Performance Computing (MPI | OpenMP | Parallel C++)  
- Data Engineering & Analytics
